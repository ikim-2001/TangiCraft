# drop point: preset IRL coordinates that determine where a block is placed. block's location is based on the closest
# drop point the block is located at

# index set: the indices that the drop point has in the 2D array. Maps to point that tells Minecraft where to
# build (pretend the building space in Minecraft is a grid)
